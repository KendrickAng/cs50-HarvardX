1.  stdint.h is a standard library which provides typedefs and macros (such as #define) for fixed-width integral types, as defined in C99 standard.

2.  uint8_t, uint16_t and uint32_t are unsigned integers of size 8bits (range 0-255), 16bits (0 to 65535) and 32 bits (0 to 4,294,967,295) respectively. 
    They can only hold positive numbers. int32_t is a signed integer of size 32bits (âˆ’2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647), and can hold positve and negative numbers.
    Used to store the primitive data types.
    
3.  BYTE stores 1 byte, DWORD stores 4 bytes, LONG stores 4 bytes, WORD stores 2 bytes.

4.  The first two bytes are the ASCII character 'B' followed by ASCII character 'M'.

5.  bfSize is the size, in bytes, of a bitmap file (including the header files). biSize is the size, in bytes, of the BITMAPINFOHEADER header file.

6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top down Device-Independent Bitmap. The origin of the bitmap as defined by the sequence of bytes in the bitmap file is the 
    top-left corner of the bitmap image.

7.  biBitCount

8.  The file-opening operation fails- The file might not exist, the user might not have permission to access the file or there might not be enough memory to open it.

9.  The 3rd agrument represents the number of elements of data. As only 1 file is open, only 1 element of data is to be read, so fread's third arguemnt will always be 1.

11. fseek is used to set the file position indicator for the stream (as pointed to by its first argument) to a new position.

12. SEEK_CUR defines the position from which the offset (as defined in the 2nd argument of fseek) is added, thus determining the new file position indicator for the stream.
